# bio_analysis
This project is a group assignment for 9785 in University of Canberra, which is related to data analysis. Specifically, it will analysis data generated by other bioanalytical software such as [Roary](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/).

The steps of analysis includes: 

- Data Extraction
- Data pre-processing
- Visualization(venn diagram, upsetplot)

Many excellent Python open source libraries are used in the project for data analysis, such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. Meanwhile, [pyvenn](https://github.com/tctianchi/pyvenn) and [UpSetPlot](https://upsetplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) make great contribution to the visulization. 

Great appreciation to these authors for contributing these excellent and convenient open source libraries.
